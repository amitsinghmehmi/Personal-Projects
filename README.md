Yahtzee.java : A game that mimics the real life Yahtzee game with a roll of 5 dice. This program is written in java and utilizes while loops, for loops, JOptionPane, Arrays, 
               images, variables, if, else if, && and || statements. This program was created for one of our labs in my IC3UO course, where I decided to go above and beyond 
               by adding a betting system and for loop to mimic a gamble. The use of arrays allowed me to display the number of occurances of faces in the user's roll as well 
               as helping the program decide whether the user won; four of a kind, three of a kind, small straight, large straight, full house or yahtzee, assuming the rolls
               are from greatest to least.
